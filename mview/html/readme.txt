how to use:
- put video files and these files in same directory
- run that convert bat file if they arent mp4s(webm support not coming, too much potential bloat)
- run index.js to create a list of mp4s for the html file to consume(requires ffmpeg globally accessible)
- open index.html file(only tested chrome and firefox)
